# Tiktok Dance Recognizer 
Project for AICD3 CDD 204 that aims to identify tiktok dances via a deep learning neural network.


# Idea 1: 
* Vision transformer video classifier + MLP head


# Idea 2: 
* CNN + RNN video classifier + softmax 


# Functions 
1) If binary, -> Output node needs to have sigmoid activation function
2) If multiclass, -> output node needs to have softmax 


# Tiktok Dance Classifier 

Project for BMI 212 (2025) that aims to identify TikTok dances via a machine learning algorithm. 

# Architecture 
We use Google AI Edge's MediaPipe to
